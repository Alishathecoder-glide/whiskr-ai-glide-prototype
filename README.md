## Technologies Used  
- Glide (for app frontend and user interface)

## Key Features  
- AI Chatbot “Whiskers” that provides personalized pet care advice  
- Photo and video analysis for pet behavior and health monitoring  
- Smart reminders for feeding, medication, exercise, and vet visits

## Challenges Faced  
- Embedding AI chatbot into Glide app was not possible due to platform limitations, leading to a manual workaround using Google Sheets integration  
- Working with FlutterFlow posed some difficulties without prior coding experience  
- Balancing theoretical knowledge from AS Level Computer Science with practical app development
