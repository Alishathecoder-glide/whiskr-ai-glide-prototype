# Whiskr.AI — Your AI Pet Care Companion

## Project Description  
Whiskr.AI is an AI-powered pet care assistant designed to help pet owners provide personalized and intelligent care for their pets. The app offers tailored advice on nutrition, health monitoring, behavior analysis, and daily reminders, making pet care easier and more efficient for busy owners.


## Technologies Used  
- Glide (for app frontend and user interface)  
- FlutterFlow (for prototyping and app development)  
- Chatbase AI (for AI chatbot assistant ‘Whiskers’)  
- Google Sheets (for backend data storage and management)

## Key Features  
- AI Chatbot “Whiskers” that provides personalized pet care advice  
- Photo and video analysis for pet behavior and health monitoring  
- Smart reminders for feeding, medication, exercise, and vet visits

## Challenges Faced  
- Embedding AI chatbot into Glide app was not possible due to platform limitations, leading to a manual workaround using Google Sheets integration  
- Working with FlutterFlow posed some difficulties without prior coding experience  
- Balancing theoretical knowledge from AS Level Computer Science with practical app development
